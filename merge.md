title: Observe the merged contributions

***

**!!! If the session is live!!!**: go see your collaborator merge your pull request! Most likely it will be a thumbs up and result in a merge! But your collaborator might also request a correction if they spot an error. 


<br />



**If you are following this tutorial on your own asynchronously**: These are the steps of the merge: 

<br />

1. **Collaborator's screen - GitHub**: In their pull request tab, they will inspect the files you changed and ensure that the parameters were inputted correctly so as to not break down their code down the line.

<br />

2. **Collaborator's screen - GitHub**: They will navigate back to the conversation tab of your pull request to write some comments, merge your pull request, and confirm the merge.

<br />

3. **Collaborator's screen - RStudio**: They will pull their GitHub repository into their local repository.

<br />


4. **Collaborator's screen - RStudio**: They will knit the Rmarkdown file `plot-trait-evolution.Rmd` which sources all the contributed files. Knitting a Rmarkdown file means rendering the Rmarkdown code (that integrate R code and Markdown code) into a defined format, here a html file. This file generates plots and figures based on the parameters that were contributed.

5. **Collaborator's screen - RStudio**: If all packages needed to run this script and to knit the file into a html page are installed, this file will generate plots and figures based on the parameters that were contributed.

This is how one can integrate data and code to a common repository shared amongst collaborators!
