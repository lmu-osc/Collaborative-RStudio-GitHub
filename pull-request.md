# Create a pull request to ask your collaborator to merge your fork to the original repository

***

1. **GitHub**: in your repository, click on '**contribute**' and '**open pull request**'

2. **GitHub**: make sure the base repository is Malika's original one and the head fork is yours, both set on their main branch (these repositories should only have one branch anyway called 'main'. Branches are diverging versions of a file **within** a repository - we will not cover this concept today). Check that your requested merge does not create any conflict. If all is good, click on `Create pull request`

3. **GitHub**: write an informative message, explaining your changes to your collaborator, the author of the original repository. Click on `Create pull request`

4. **GitHub**: check to see your collaborator's response to your request and check the original repository to see your merged changes. Most likely it will be a thumbs up! But your collaborator might also **request a correction** if they spot an error.  If this session is live: go see the instructor and ask them to watch while they merge your pull request.
